# Accident Data Analysis
This Shiny App gives insight into the accident data. The explorer allows the user of this App to select a state in the United States and a month which will enable the App to display 
1.  the corresponding number of deaths in the state
2.  the Light and Weather conditions when the accident happened
3.  the gender of the person involved in the accident and
4.  a data table that shows the data table of frequency of accidents that happened on the day of the week
